//go:build !dot && !spot

// Package display is the Echo Show's screen: what the device shows on it, what a finger on it does,
// and what Home Assistant gets for it.
//
// The screen follows the conversation. Idle, it is a clock; while a turn runs it says what the
// device is doing and shows the words — what was heard, then the answer — and lets them linger a
// while after the turn ends. Everything is drawn by the daemon itself onto the kernel framebuffer
// (hardware/screen): no compositor, no browser, no Android.
//
// A tap does what the Dot's action button does: starts a turn, or ends the one running; on a dark
// screen it only lights it. A vertical swipe is the volume, a notch per step, with the level shown
// while it moves. The room's light dims the panel when auto-brightness is on; what Home Assistant
// sets is the ceiling.
//
// To Home Assistant the screen is a light with brightness only — on/off and how bright, which is
// what people automate — plus a switch for auto-brightness.
